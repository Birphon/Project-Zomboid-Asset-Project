# Project Zomboid Asset Creator - Development Progress

A third-party asset creator/editor for Project Zomboid modding, built with Godot to simplify the mod development workflow.

## Project Vision

This tool aims to streamline Project Zomboid mod creation by:
- **Automatic Setup**: Finds your Zomboid installation and creates proper mod folder structures
- **Script Management**: Reads and manages all game scripts with proper syntax support
- **Enhanced Editing**: Integrated ZedScript and Umbrella (Lua) syntax highlighting
- **Asset Handling**: Simplified item viewing, image importing, and asset management
- **Developer Tools**: JavaDocs integration for quick reference and snippets

> **This is a heavy work-in-progress tool and will require constant updates when The Indie Stone updates their game!**

## Design Decisions

### Open Questions:
- Should we create a custom scripting language (ZombieCode?) or stick with ZedScript/Umbrella?
- What's the best approach for file editing UI?
- How deep should model editing go?

## Why This Project?

After struggling with Project Zomboid's modding workflow and seeing Hytale's integrated Asset Editor, I realized the PZ modding community could benefit from a dedicated third-party tool. This project aims to lower the barrier to entry for new modders and speed up development for experienced ones.
